The product controller is responsible for handling requests related to products in a Spring Boot application. It provides the following routes:

1. Route: POST /products
   Description: This route is used to create a new product. The request body should be a JSON object containing the product data.

2. Route: GET /products/{id}
   Description: This route is used to retrieve the details of a specific product based on its ID. The product ID should be provided as a parameter in the URL.

3. Route: GET /products
   Description: This route is used to retrieve all available products.

Please note that you need to replace the parameter values, such as the product ID, when making the requests. These routes can be accessed through HTTP requests to interact with the products in the application.

This API is designed to be simple and beginner-friendly, making it a great starting point for learning Spring Boot development. It provides basic functionality for creating and retrieving products. Feel free to explore and experiment with these routes to gain hands-on experience with building APIs using Spring Boot.
